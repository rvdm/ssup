# ssup
A simple script to upload screenshots to a web server using Automator.app .

Set the parameters in the code correctly:
```python
# set the length of the autogenerated file name
filename_length = 4

# set the file type of your screenshots
filetype = ".png"

# host to scp to
hostname = "rvdm.net"

# path on the host to scp to
path = "screenshots/s/"

# base URL to be prepended to the uploaded file
urlpath = "https://rvdm.net/s"
```

The script assumes you have working keys and/or ssh-agent set up.
